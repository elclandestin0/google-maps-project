A Neighbourhood Map powered by Google Maps and other 3rd party APIs!

Hello and welcome to "What's Good In The Hood"! This is a web-application, powered by Foursquare & Google Maps API, to display instant destinations around you in the map from three different categories:
<li> Nightlife </li>
<li> Eat </li> 
<li> Sports center </li>

To get this baby up and running, simply <code>git clone</code> this repository or download it's zip. Next, open <code> index.html</code> in your favourite text editor and compile the file!
<strong> NOTE: </strong> a moderate internet connection is required to load the Maps and the Foursquare APIs. 

This is the main page of the application. The web-app starts with <strong>Montreal, QC</strong> as the initial starting point. The listings and the markers shown here are the food items in Montreal by default.

Type in any city of your choice in the text box on the left. Here, we type up Toulouse, France (autocompleted by <a href="https://developers.google.com/places/"> Places </a>). Clicking on <code>Go</code> zooms in on the city you search.
